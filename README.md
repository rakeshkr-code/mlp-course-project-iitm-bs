# mlp-course-project-iitm-bs

### **Description**
This is an extended version of Machine Learning course project - `Marketing Strategy(Personalized Offer)``. The given data is collected through a survey to understand the driver's behavior regarding their preference for discount/offer for dining/takeaway. The researcher collected these data by providing different scenarios to various users.

### **Steps**
- Imports: Importing necessary libraries and modules.
- EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis.
- X-Y Split: Splitting the dataset into features and target variables.
- Preprocessing: Data preprocessing and transformation.
- Initial Model Training & Performance: Training initial models and evaluating performance.
- Define Hyperparameters & Plotting Functions: Setting hyperparameters and functions for plotting.
Execute HPT and Plotting Performance Metrics of Top 3
- Models: Hyperparameter tuning and performance analysis.
- Tuned Model Performance Analysis: Analyzing the performance of tuned models.
- Training Final Model with Best Params on Entire Dataset: Training the final model.
- Tree Analysis: Analyzing tree-based models.
- SHAP Analysis: Analyzing SHAP values and understanding business strategies.
